# Binary Search Tree (BST) Algorithms

## Overview
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that maintains sorted order of elements, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Operations
1. **Insertion**
   - Insert a new value into the BST.
   - Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

2. **Deletion**
   - Remove a value from the BST.
   - Time Complexity: O(h).

3. **Searching**
   - Find a value in the BST.
   - Time Complexity: O(h).

4. **Traversal**
   - **In-order Traversal**: Visits nodes in ascending order.
   - **Pre-order Traversal**: Visits the root node first.
   - **Post-order Traversal**: Visits the root node last.
   - **Level-order Traversal**: Visits nodes level by level.

5. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values**
   - Find the node with the minimum or maximum value in the BST.

6. **Finding Successor and Predecessor**
   - Find the in-order successor or predecessor of a given node.

7. **Balancing Check**
   - Check if the BST is balanced.

8. **Kth Smallest and Kth Largest**
   - Find the kth smallest or largest element in the BST.

## Summary
The BST provides efficient operations for dynamic data storage and retrieval, making it a fundamental data structure in computer science.
