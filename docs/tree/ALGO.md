# Tree Algorithms

## Overview
A Tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root and other nodes as children.

## Operations
1. **Insertion**
   - Insert a new node into the tree.
   - Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

2. **Traversal**
   - **Pre-order Traversal**: Visits the root node first.
   - **In-order Traversal**: Visits nodes in ascending order.
   - **Post-order Traversal**: Visits the root node last.
   - **Level-order Traversal**: Visits nodes level by level.

3. **Finding Depth**
   - Calculate the maximum depth of the tree.

4. **Finding Diameter**
   - Calculate the diameter of the tree.

5. **Finding Lowest Common Ancestor**
   - Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.

6. **Vertical Order Traversal**
   - Traverse the tree in vertical order.

## Summary
Trees are versatile data structures used in various applications, including databases, file systems, and more.
