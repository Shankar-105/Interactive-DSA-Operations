# Interactive DSA Simulator

A menu-driven, console-based mini Java project designed to help you **learn,understand,visualize, and practice core Data Structures and Algorithms** through hands-on interaction by super freindly menu and with a rich documentation of each operation.

**Documentations Cmg Soon!!!**

## 🌟 Why This Project?

- **Not just code**: Along with source code, you get detailed, beginner-friendly documentation on each data structure covering not only *how* to use them but *why* and *how* they work.
- **Menu-based Simulation**: Experiment with data structures through super freindly menus.

- **You can even Learn**: visualized outputs, with each code being the optimal solution for the question and algorithm explanations provided in each Data Structure docs in super simple words enabling deeper understanding.
- **Documentation Included**: Each menu has its own structured documentation of the algorithms and logic, making this even a learning resource.

- **Covering Interview Probelms**: This project is not just a bunch of operations but rather each operation is an interview level probelm covering leetcode level probelms with being put into an user freindly menu.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- **Strengthen your DSA Fundamentals:**  
  Practice operations on data structures, and connect to theory with the doucmentation.
- **Understand the Algorithms:**  
  Read detailed documentation for each menu operation and understand the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind every code.
- **Interview Prep:**  
  Not just a bunch of operations but it has alot of operations from leetcode which are thoroughly asked in interviews Perfect for students, interviewees, or anyone on with Java-based DSA.
