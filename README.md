# Interactive DSA Simulator

Welcome to the Interactive DSA Simulator!  
A console-based, menu-driven Java mini-project designed to help you **learn, visualize, and experiment with core Data Structures** through an intuitive, interactive CLI.

---
## 🖥️ User Experience

- **Intuitive Menus:** Every data structure guides you with clear menus and outputs and explanations clearly specified in separate folders.
- **Step-by-step Prompts:** Enter data, choose operations, and see immediate interactive outputs/results.
- **Visual Output:** Lists and trees are displayed in a user-friendly format, with mini-diagrams for trees/heaps.
- **Animated Traversals:** (Coming soon) Gonna use the Threading in java and Simulate traversals step-by-step like animations.
